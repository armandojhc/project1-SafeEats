# Project 1: Choice Eats

“Choice Eats” is a web app that allows the user to search for recipes based on ingredients or dishes while having the option to  filter unwanted ones. This is a one stop search site that allows you to seamlessly get access to thousands of recipe choices in one click.

## Objective:

The app should utilize server side APIs and third party APIs to obtain data based on user’s inputs. Use html , css, and JavaScript to built a concise working application that utilizes Materialize framework to complement the styling of the overall project.

## User Walkthrough

When the user opens the application he/she will encounter the home page with two search bars , one for the dish or ingredient to search a recipe for and an optional search bar to filter out unwanted food term / ingredient.

Clicking on the search button will trigger the API call and list all of the recipes that meet this criteria. Next to each of the recipes the user will be able to view a quick list of ingredients for that particular recipe along with a GIF related to the main search terms . This GIF is extracted from the Giphy API that has been included in the code . At the bottom of this modem window there will be a link that takes the user directly to the recipe’s source website where all of full recipe should be displayed.

Clicking on the add button will store the recipe array in localStorage. The user will be able to retrieve these by licking in the Recipes button at the top right corner of the page header. Once the user navigates to the saved recipe list, he/she will be able to once again view the recipe or delete it from the saved list.

## How to use:
